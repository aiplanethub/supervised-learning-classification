* Naive Bayes is the most straightforward and fast classification algorithm, which is suitable for a large chunk of data.
* Naive Bayes classifier is successfully used in various applications such as spam filtering, text classification, sentiment analysis, and recommender systems.
* It uses the Bayes theorem of probability to predict the class.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

* Advantages:  
This algorithm requires a small amount of training data to estimate the necessary parameters. Naive Bayes classifiers are extremely fast compared to more sophisticated methods.
* Disadvantages: Naive Bayes is known to be a bad estimator.

## Multinomial Gaussian NB for spam detection

**Note:**

In the following video, the instructor used the spam detection example that involves some operations around text (NLP).

You donâ€™t need to worry about those parts and instead focus on the parts revolving around Naive Bayes.
