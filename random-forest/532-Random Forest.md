Random forest is a flexible, easy-to-use machine learning algorithm that produces a great result most of the time, even without hyper-parameter tuning.

It is also one of the most used algorithms because of its simplicity and diversity (it **can be used for both classification and regression tasks**).

Random forest **builds multiple decision trees and merges them** to get a more accurate and stable prediction.

### Random Forest: Ensemble tree-based algorithm

It is an ensemble tree-based learning algorithm. The Random Forest Classifier is a set of decision trees from a randomly selected subset of the training set. It aggregates the votes from different decision trees to decide the final class of the test object.

## Applications

* The random forest algorithm is used in many fields, like banking, the stock market, medicine, and e-commerce.
* In finance, for example, it is used to detect customers more likely to repay their debt on time or use a bank's services more frequently. In this domain, it is also used to detect fraudsters out to scam the bank. In trading, the algorithm can be used to determine a stock's future behavior.
* In the healthcare domain, it is used to identify the correct combination of components in medicine and to analyze a patient's medical history to identify diseases.
* Random forest is used in e-commerce to determine whether a customer will like the product.
