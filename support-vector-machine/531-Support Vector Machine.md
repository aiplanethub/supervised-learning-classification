## SVMâ€™s Objective

The objective of SVMs is to categorize data into two classes. It does so by finding a separating hyperplane(decision boundary), where the distance between itself and the closest data points for both categories is maximized.

Look at how the hyperplane lies precisely between the nearby blue and red points (maximizing the margin)

## Kernels

* SVM algorithms use a set of mathematical functions that are defined as the kernel.
* The function of the kernel is to take data as input and transform it into the required form.
* Different SVM algorithms use different types of kernel functions. These functions can be different types.
* For example, linear, nonlinear, polynomial, radial basis function (RBF), and sigmoid.
* The most used type of kernel function is RBF. It is also the default kernel.
